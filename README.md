Things I've hacked together to use with my Raspberry Pi

upDown is a program that works with 2 buttons and 8 LED lights. Using the up button switches the next light on and the previous light off. The opposite is true with the down button. The GPIO input numbers for the LEDs and the buttons are hard-coded in, so for this to be functional you should replace them with the GPIO pins that you use.
